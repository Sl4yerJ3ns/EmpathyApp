This project is basically an app designed to teach people about inclusivity towards people with disabilities. This is done by providing real-life examples and demos that can demonstrate what it is like to live with the disabilty.

You can try out this project by going to our releases page. (https://github.com/Sl4yerJ3ns/EmpathyApp/releases) I do plan on publishing this to the Google Play Store, as soon as I can get a working app (without too much UI customization, etc.)
