This project is basically an app designed to teach people about inclusivity towards people with disabilities. This is done by providing real-life examples and demos that can demonstrate what it is like to live with the disabilty.

You can try out this project by going to our releases page. (https://github.com/Sl4yerJ3ns/EmpathyApp/releases) I do plan on publishing this to the Google Play Store, as soon as I can get a working app (without too much UI customization, etc.) I will also be releasing APKs along side the source code as soon as I can get a working app.

If you would like to try out the source code yourself, please refer to Android Studio for instructions on how to try it out.
